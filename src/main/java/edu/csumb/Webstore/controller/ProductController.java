//The controller file determines where someone can access your service.

    //REQUESTMAPPING
    //We are setting a request mapping with request type GET. You can change these to POST or anything else you want!
    //The value is the location of the api. So this would be HEROKU/products/example

    //APIOPERATION
    //This is comments that will be displayed in swagger. Remember to do this or you will lose points!

    //EXAMPLE()
    //We are returning an Iterable, which means a List! Use Iterable<Datatype> when you want to return many.
    //For example Iterable<Product>

    //NETWORKING QUICK REFERENCE
    //IF @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, value = "/example/{var}")
    //Then you should use @RequestParam to get the variable, like so
    // public returnType getVar(@RequestParam DataType var)

    //IF  @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST, value = "/example")
    //Then you should use @RequestBody to get the variable, like so.
    //public returnType foo(@RequestBody dataType var)

    //Put and Delete will use either. They can also be compiled.
    // So IF @RequestMapping(value = "/{pathVar}", method = RequestMethod.PUT)
    //public void foo(@RequestParam dataType pathVar, @RequestBody dataType postVar)
